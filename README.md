# Rocksmith Mic Reset
Whenever I leave the game Rocksmith 2014 it decides it wants to set my Default Recording Device volume to some silly low number leaving me to sound like a dormouse when I next enter a voice chat. 

This _teeny-tiny_ script is just a one-click solution to pump those numbers back up to 100 because Windows 10 put too many clicks into getting to Sound Control Panel let alone to the Recording device properties.

This Powershell script utilises the Powershell Cmdlet `AudioDeviceCmdlets` - [Github Link](https://github.com/frgnca/AudioDeviceCmdlets).
